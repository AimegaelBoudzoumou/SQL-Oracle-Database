## 1. Introduction

Data modelling is the process of taking user requirements and translating them into a table design. This is a large topic, worthy of a full course in its own right! This tutorial gives a brief overview of the process.

## 2. Overview

The basic steps for designing a database for a new application are:

- Capturing requirements
- Build the conceptual model
- Design the logical model
- Create the physical model

Building a database is an iterative process. As you go through the steps, consult with the users regularly to check it meets their needs. Often you'll need to adjust the model as you hone in on what the system must do.

## 3. Capturing Requirements

The first step in building a database is to find out what information you need to store. To complete this process, speak with people who will use the system. This could be potential customers or in-house staff in the business.

For example, say you're building a system to manage appointments for hospital clinics. This will allow patients to:

- View available appointment times & select one to attend
- View details of upcoming appointments they've booked
